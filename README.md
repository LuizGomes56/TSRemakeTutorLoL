## Production version of TutorLoL

- Available at [TutorLoL](https://front.tutorlol.com).
- This is an old rewritten version in TypeScript of tutorlolv1, that was written in JavaScript

## Changes

- This version is not as powerful as the one in JavaScript. Some functionalities are not available, and calculations are not as realiable.
- Frontend was completelly remade, using React and received major design updates. Since some features are not available, the design is also more minimalistic
